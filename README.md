# Inventory-Management
This program will allow a user to upload, browse, and search using multiple terms for items in a (theoretical) car dealerships current inventory. The store owner will be able to upload and edit their inventory data.
Front end uses HTML, and React/JS 
processing mostly done via Javascript
Data storage handled by PouchDB to allow for offline, client-side only usage. In it's current state, the database is stored locally and does not offer an option for connecting to remote DB. Remote DataBase functionality will most likely not be implemented.

Big thanks to developers of: PouchDB (https://pouchdb.com/), Node.JS (nodejs.org), and React(Reactjs.org).
